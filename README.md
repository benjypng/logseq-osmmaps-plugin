# Overview

This plugin looks for coordinates or Google Maps links on your page and plots them as markers on a map. You may use it to journal an event, or record down something memorable that happened there.

# Usage

## Step 1

Configure your default zoom level and default location in the plugin settings. This will apply to all future maps.

## Step 2

Start by using the slash command `/Add map`. Make the desired changes to the renderer. For example, in `{{renderer :map_66a602dc-12bc-4abe-8fe0-36e776438fb5, 10, Singapore}}`, the zoom level is 10 and the default location is Singapore.

*Note: This plugin assumes that there will only be one map per page.*

## Step 3

To start creating markers, you may choose any of the below options. They can work together on the same map.

### Using blocks

Ensure that the block has a property `coords`. `coords` can be either in the form of simplified or transitional latitude and longitude, or a Google Maps link.

```
Jurong Bird Park
coords:: 1.3187째 N, 103.7064째 E

Jurong Bird Park
coords:: 1.3187, 103.7064

Jurong Bird Park
coords:: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jurong+Bird+Park/@1.3190699,103.7043014,17z
```

### Using Queries

You can also use queries to create markers. Simply add in the following query in a page containing the map:

```
{{query (property :coords)}}
```

You may add other query parameters, but it is important that you include `(property :coords)`.

### Right-clicking on map

When right-clicking on the map, you can automatically create a marker, and a new block will be inserted on the page with the coordinates you just created.

## Changing colours

You may also change colours of your markers by adding in a `marker-color` property. For example:

```
Jurong Bird Park
coords:: 1.3187째 N, 103.7064째 E
marker-color:: red
```
